Air Quality Monitoring with MQ135 + DHT11 + LCD

This Arduino project measures air quality, temperature, and humidity using the MQ135 gas sensor and DHT11 sensor, with real-time feedback displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD. It uses LEDs and a buzzer for visual and audible alerts based on air quality conditions.

Features
- LED indicators (Green/Yellow/Red) for Good, Moderate, and Bad air quality.
- Buzzer alert when air quality is poor.
- Temperature and Humidity readings via DHT11 sensor.
- LCD display for real-time monitoring.

 Raw Sensor Thresholds
- Raw < 100: Good
- 100 ≤ Raw < 300: Moderate
- Raw ≥ 300: Bad (Buzzer On)

 Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- MQ135 Gas Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- 3 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red)
- Buzzer
- Resistors & Jumper Wires

Who This Helps
- Students and hobbyists looking to learn about environmental monitoring using Arduino.
- Homeowners who want a simple and affordable way to monitor indoor air quality.
- Schools and educators who want to teach air pollution awareness and sensor integration.
- People with respiratory conditions (like asthma) who want to track air quality in their living environment.
- Researchers and developers looking for a baseline project to build advanced air quality systems.

This project promotes health awareness by providing immediate feedback on air pollution levels, helping users take timely actions to improve air quality and well-being.
